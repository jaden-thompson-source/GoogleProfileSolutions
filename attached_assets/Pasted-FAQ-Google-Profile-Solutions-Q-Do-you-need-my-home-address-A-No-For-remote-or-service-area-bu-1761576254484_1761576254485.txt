FAQ – Google Profile Solutions

Q: Do you need my home address?
A: No. For remote or service-area businesses, we can verify your profile without exposing your address publicly. Your privacy is protected.

Q: How long does verification take?
A: Verification can take anywhere from 1–7 days depending on Google’s method (postcard, phone/email, or video). We’ll guide you through the fastest method available for your business.

Q: What documents do you need?
A: Usually a business license, registration documents, or utility bill showing your business name and address. We’ll tell you exactly what’s needed to avoid delays.

Q: Can you optimize my profile too?
A: Yes! Our Verification + Optimization package ensures your profile is complete, professional, and attractive to customers.

Q: I don’t have a storefront. Can I still be verified?
A: Absolutely. We specialize in service-area businesses and home-based businesses. Verification can be done via video or phone without showing a public address.

Q: What if Google rejects my verification?
A: We troubleshoot all common rejection reasons. Our process minimizes the chance of errors and we’ll work with you to get verified successfully.

Q: Will I lose access to my profile if you manage it?
A: No. You remain the owner. We’re granted temporary manager access only for verification and optimization. You stay in full control.

Q: How many locations can you handle?
A: We can verify and optimize single or multiple locations. Pricing scales per location. Multi-location businesses are welcome!

Q: Can this service increase my customer leads?
A: Yes. Verified and optimized profiles appear higher in Google Maps and Search, making it easier for potential customers to find you and contact you.

Q: Is this a recurring service?
A: Verification is a one-time process, but we also offer ongoing profile management for posts, reviews, and updates as a monthly service.

Q: Do I need a website for this?
A: No, but having one can help speed up verification and improve your profile’s SEO. If you don’t have a website, we can still verify and optimize your profile.
